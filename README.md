# About Me

Full stack web developer and U.S. Navy veteran with a background in geophysics and scientific computing. As a researcher at the University of Minnesota I worked collaboratively with several research groups as the manager of the X-ray Computed Tomography Laboratory. For 15 years I have written code in C, Matlab, and Python to solve scientific problems. For the past year I have worked as a geospatial developer at the Polar Geospatial Center at the University of Minnesota. I was part of a 5 person developer team working on satellite imagery using supercomputers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and the NASA Center for Climate Simulation. I have extensive knowledge and experience developing algorithms to solve scientific problems. I am currently working on a Full Stack Web Development Certificate from the University of Minnesota. I'm excited to combine my scientific computing skills with my newly acquired Fullstack Developer skills to solve web related problems.
