# Professional Portfolio for Brian Bagley

## Purpose
This page is for potential employer's to view examples of my work. It also provides contact information and links to Github and LinkedIn.

## Goals
At a minimum this page should provide the following information:

- Name, photo, examples of work, and contact information
- The first web application should be larger than the rest of the examples
- Responsive layout

## Future Delevopment
I will continue to update this page throughout the course. 

Hopefully this can be used along with a resume to demonstrate that am I a good candidate for a job.
