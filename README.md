# About Me
I am a geophysicist with a background in seismology and X-ray Computed Tomography. I've spent the
past 10 years working in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of 
Minnesota as a researcher and geospatial developer. I'm looking forward to a new career as a full
stack developer building and deploying web applications.
